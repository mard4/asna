# CONSIDERATIONS:
# - Betweenness centrality identifies scientists who act as "bridges" or intermediaries between different groups or clusters 
#   in the network.
# - beta centrality not correlated with department group: Scientistsâ€™ influence in the network 
#   (as measured by their direct and indirect connections) is not restricted to or dominated by their 
#   departmental group. Collaborations likely transcend departmental boundaries, and a scientist's structural 
#   importance depends more on their position in the overall network rather than their departmental affiliation. 
#   It might also suggest that departmental groupings are not a strong factor in collaboration patterns, 
#   indicating a culture of cross-group interaction or research driven by non-departmental factors 
#   (e.g., shared projects, funding sources, or individual preferences).
# - degree correlated with department group: While the effect size (correlation) is small, it indicates that 
#   departmental affiliation influences how many direct collaborations scientists have.
# - While direct collaborations (degree centrality) are slightly associated with departmental group, the 
#   broader influence (beta-centrality) is not. This could suggest that while scientists tend to collaborate 
#   more within their department, the network's global structure is not strongly shaped by departmental 
#   boundaries. The weak and significant correlation of degree centrality with department suggests potential 
#   siloing in direct collaborations. The lack of correlation for beta-centrality implies that structural
#   importance and influence are driven by broader network factors rather than departmental affiliation.
